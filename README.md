# Vue.js ToDo Frontend

This project demonstrates a simple frontend application developed with Vue.js. In this project, we will
consume [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) API prepared in the 
[Spring Boot ToDo Backend](https://github.com/tareq403/SpringBoot-ToDo-Backend) project.
We shall prepare a simple list view to show the list of todos, prepare a create view to add new todo entry and
an edit view to modify an existing todo. We shall be using Vue router to navigate between the views.
